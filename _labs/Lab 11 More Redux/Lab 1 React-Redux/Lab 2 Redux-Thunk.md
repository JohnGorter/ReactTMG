# Lab Redux-Thunk
Time: 30 minutes

# Excercise 1. Create a backend api
Programm an express server that exposes a couple of endpoints to accept and respond with todos:
- an api endpoint to retrieve all todos
- an api eindpoint to add a new todo
- an api endpoint to retrieve a single todo given it's id


# Excercise 2. Implement Redux thunk functions
Use Redux and thunk middleware to get and store todos from the server.
While the fetches are 'in-flight' make sure to display some sort of progress indicator.
